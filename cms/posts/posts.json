      "content": "<p>Running a side hustle while maintaining a full-time job requires exceptional time management. Here's how to make the most of your limited hours without burning out:</p><h2>Time Blocking</h2><p>Dedicate specific blocks of time to your side hustle and protect these hours fiercely. Even 30 minutes of focused work is better than hours of distracted effort.</p><h2>Energy Management</h2><p>Identify when you have the most mental energy and schedule your most demanding tasks during these periods. For many, early mornings or weekends work best for creative or complex tasks.</p><h2>Automation</h2><p>Invest time in setting up systems that automate repetitive tasks. This could include email sequences, social media scheduling, or template responses for common inquiries.</p><h2>Batching</h2><p>Group similar tasks together and complete them in one session. For example, create a month's worth of social media content in one sitting rather than daily posts.</p><h2>Strategic Outsourcing</h2><p>Identify low-value tasks that consume significant time and consider outsourcing them. This might include bookkeeping, customer service, or content creation.</p><p>Remember that consistency trumps intensity. It's better to work on your side hustle for 30 minutes daily than to burn out with occasional 8-hour marathon sessions.</p>",
