# Blog Posts Directory

This directory contains individual HTML files for each blog post.

These files are automatically generated when a new post is created or updated through the CMS.

Each file follows the naming convention of `[slug].html` where `slug` is the URL-friendly version of the post title.

For example, a post titled "Top 5 Side Hustles for 2025" would have a slug of "top-5-side-hustles-2025" and would be saved as `top-5-side-hustles-2025.html`.

Do not manually edit these files as they will be overwritten by the CMS.
